### Employee Payroll Tracker
Description
This project is my solution to a JavaScript Employee Payroll Tracker challenge. The application is designed to help payroll managers manage and view employee payroll data efficiently. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and ensures a clean, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The key functionality includes the ability to add employees, track their salaries, and display the data alphabetically on the webpage. Additionally, it calculates and displays important payroll metrics, such as the average salary, in the console.
